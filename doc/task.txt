Test task PHP - Payroll


Introduction:

XYZ is a company with employees assigned to specific departments. Each employee can only
be a member of one department. A bonus to the basic salary is calculated depending on the
department where the employee works. This bonus can be expressed in two ways:

1. A fixed amount is added to the basic salary for each year of work
2. Percentage - a value given as a percentage per year, different for each department
3. A department can have a limit in years for which the bonus applies or not

Examples:

A) Adam Kowalski from HR has been with XYZ for 15 years. His base salary is $1,000. The HR
Department receives a bonus of $100 for each year of work up to 10 years. With the bonus (for
his first 10 years of work), his monthly salary is $2,000.

B) Ania Nowak has been working in the customer service department for 5 years. Her base
salary is $1,100. The customer service department receives a 10% bonus yearly. So her
monthly salary is currently $1,771.56.



Task:

Create a CLI command or a controller that creates a payroll report for the company (for the
current month). The report should include the following:

 - Name
 - Surname
 - Department
 - Remuneration base (amount)
 - Addition to the base (amount) - one of two options described in the introduction
 - Bonus type (% or fixed type)
 - Salary with bonus (amount)

The results must be sortable by any column (one at a time).
The results must be filterable by department, name, and surname.
